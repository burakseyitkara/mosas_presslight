We also have one paper "CoLight: Learning Network-level Cooperation for Traffic Signal Control" accepted by CIKM 2019.

And the code base for CoLight is more advanced in terms of structure and compatibility with CityFlow simulator. You can check that out at [here](https://github.com/wingsweihua/colight)
